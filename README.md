# IMAGE-AUMENTATION
Augmenting image via different deep learning models and creating cooler stuff

This is a simple CNN model used for converting black and white images to colored images based on encoder-fusion-decoder. First , the image is encodeded, then a suion layer is applied in which output from encoder is fused with output from resnet V2 classifier running parallely and then the fused output is decoded back to give the desried colored image as output

Future Scope- Study the effect of GAN and C-GAN in this field and implement the same
